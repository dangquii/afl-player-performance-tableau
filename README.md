# AFL Player Performance Analysis — Tableau

This project explores the performance of over 600 AFL players across 15 seasons using an interactive Tableau dashboard. The goal was to turn raw Excel data into visual insights that help coaches, analysts, and fans better understand player trends, strengths, and game impact.

## What I Did

- Designed a Tableau dashboard to visualize KPIs like average goals, goal assists, marks, and physical characteristics (height, weight)
- Used Excel to clean and prepare raw match data for analysis
- Created age-based segments and comparisons to highlight performance patterns across different stages of players’ careers
